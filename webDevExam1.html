    <p><strong> i. Ancient Japan</strong></p>
    <p>The Japanese archipelago's history dates back to the Paleolithic period, with the Jōmon period and Yayoi period following. The Yayoi people introduced iron technology and agricultural civilization, which overwhelmed the Jōmon people. Japan's kingdoms and tribes unified under a centralized government, controlled by the Emperor of Japan. The Heian period, a golden age of classical Japanese culture, saw the rise of civilian aristocrats and military clans. The Tokugawa shogunate imposed a strict class system and cut off contact with the outside world. The American Perry Expedition in 1853-54 ended Japan's seclusion, leading to the fall of the shogunate and the return of power to the emperor during the Boshin War in 1868. The Meiji period transformed Japan into an empire that closely followed Western models. Despite democracy and modern civilian culture, Japan's powerful military overruled civilian leaders in the 1920s and 1930s. The Taishō period saw democracy develop, but the Japanese military invaded Manchuria in 1931 and escalated into a prolonged war with China.</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Classical Japan</strong></p>
    <p>The classical Japanese language (文語 bungo, "literary language"), also called "old writing" (古文 kobun), sometimes simply called "Medieval Japanese" is the literary form of the Japanese language that was the standard until the early Shōwa period (1926–1989). It is based on Early Middle Japanese, the language as spoken during the Heian period (794–1185), but exhibits some later influences. Its use started to decline during the late Meiji period (1868–1912) when novelists started writing their works in the spoken form. Eventually, the spoken style came into widespread use, including in major newspapers, but many official documents were still written in the old style. After the end of World War II, most documents switched to the spoken style, although the classical style continues to be used in traditional genres, such as haiku and waka. Old laws are also left in the classical style unless fully revised.Classical Japanese began to be written during the Heian period, at which point it was very similar to spoken Japanese. It became the written standard for the Japanese language for many centuries, though the spoken language continued to evolve and by the Edo period was substantially different from classical Japanese.[1] This is known as diglossia, a situation in which two forms of a language, in this case a written and spoken form, coexist.[2] During the Meiji period, some intellectuals sought the abolition of classical Japanese, such as the Genbun Itchi movement, which proposed that written Japanese conform to the vernacular spoken language. Futabatei Shimei's 1887 novel The Drifting Cloud was one of the first novels to be written in vernacular Japanese rather than classical. By 1908, novels no longer used classical Japanese, and by the 1920s the same was true of all newspapers.[3] Government documents remained in classical Japanese until 1946.[4] Classical Japanese continues to be taught in Japanese high schools and universities due to its importance in the study of traditional Japanese literature</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Feudal Japan</strong></p>
    <p>Feudalism in medieval Japan (1185-1603) is the relationship between lords and vassals where land ownership and its use were exchanged for military service and loyalty. Although present earlier to some degree, the feudal system in Japan was really established from the beginning of the Kamakura Period in the late 12th century. The Japanese shoguns or military dictators replaced the emperor and imperial court as the country's main source of government. The shogunates then distributed land to loyal followers and these estates (shoen) were then supervised by officials such as the jito (stewards) and shugo (constables). Unlike in European feudalism, these often hereditary officials, at least initially, did not own land themselves. However, over time, the jito and shugo, operating far from the central government, gained more and more powers with many of them becoming large landowners (daimyo) in their own right and, with their own private armies, they challenged the authority of the shogunate governments. Feudalism as a nation-wide system thus broke down, even if the lord-vassal relationship did continue after the medieval period in the form of samurai offering their services to estate owners.</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Early Modern Japan</strong></p>
    <p>Early Modern Japanese (近世日本語, kinsei nihongo) was the stage of the Japanese language after Middle Japanese and before Modern Japanese.[1] It is a period of transition that shed many of the language's medieval characteristics and became closer to its modern form. The period spanned roughly 250 years and extended from the 17th century to the first half of the 19th century. Politically, it generally corresponded to the Edo period.At the beginning of the 17th century, the center of government moved to Edo from Kamigata under the control of the Tokugawa shogunate and Japan closed its borders to foreigners. Until the early Edo period, the Kamigata dialect, the ancestor of the modern Kansai dialect, was the most influential dialect. However, in the late Edo period, the Edo dialect, the ancestor of the modern Tokyo dialect, became the most influential dialect. Compared to the previous centuries, the Tokugawa rule brought about much newfound stability. That made the importance of the warrior class gradually fall and replaced it with the merchant class. There was much economic growth, and new artistic developments appeared, such as Ukiyo-e, Kabuki, and Bunraku. New literary genres such as Ukiyozōshi, Sharebon (pleasure districts), Kokkeibon (commoners), and Ninjōbon also developed. Major authors included Ihara Saikaku, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Matsuo Bashō, Shikitei Sanba, and Santō Kyōden.</p>

    <p><strong>v. Modern Japan</strong></p>
    <p>Modern Japan: A Very Short Introduction aims to explode the myths and explore the reality of modern Japan by considering its history, economy, politics, and culture. Japan is arguably today's most successful industrial economy, combining almost unprecedented affluence with social stability and apparent harmony. Japanese goods and cultural products are consumed all over the world, ranging from animated movies and computer games all the way through to cars, semiconductors, and management techniques. In many ways, Japan is an icon of the modern world, and yet it remains something of an enigma to many.</p>
